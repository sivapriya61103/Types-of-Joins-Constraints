DESCRIPTION:

The question is asking for a SQL query to retrieve all unique values of the "category" column from the "products" table.
The "products" table has several columns, including "product_id", "product_name", "category", and "price". 
Each row in the table represents a product, with its unique product ID, name, category, and price.
To retrieve all unique values of the "category" column, we can use the SQL query:
                   SELECT DISTINCT category FROM products;

This query selects the "category" column from the "products" table, and uses the DISTINCT keyword to remove any duplicate values. 
The query returns only the unique values of the "category" column.
In summary, the SQL query retrieves a distinct list of all the unique values of the "category" column from the "products" table.

SQL QUERY:

create table products (product_id int,product_name varchar(50),category varchar(20),price float);

insert into products values(1,'T-Shirt','Clothing',10.99);
insert into products values(2,'Socks','Clothing',4.99);
insert into products values(3,'Hat','Accessories',12.99);
insert into products values(4,'Shoes','Footwear',59.99);
insert into products values(5,'Backpack','Accessories',29.99);
insert into products values(6,'Pants','Clothing',24.99);

select DISTINCT category from products;

OUTPUT:

category

Clothing

Accessories

Footwear
